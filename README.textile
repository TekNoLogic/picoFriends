picoFriends is a small "LibDataBroker":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1 based info addon.
It provides a simple friends display, with a tooltip that shows detailed information about friends online.

<em> picoFriends does not provide it's own display, you will need a LDB-based display addon. </em>
